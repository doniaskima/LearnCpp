// We have to reverse a stack using recursion.
// First, we have called the reverse() function which will reverse our elements till stack is not empty.
// Then we have called insert() function inside reverse() which would add all elements at bottom of new stack.
// The insert() function will be the recursive function here.
// This function take out the topmost element, pop it and recursively call itself to insert elements.
// At last our original stack would get reversed.
